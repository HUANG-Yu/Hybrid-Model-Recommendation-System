# Hybrid-Model-Recommendation-System
This is the social network project. The model is hybrid based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

The ranking is based on the following formula. 
Score = weight(userA, userB) / shortest_distance(item X A didnt purchase but B did, any product B bought) 

The dataset is using the Amazon products, offered by Standford University. 

Other implementation: correlation pearson algorithm. Highest ranking algorithm.
